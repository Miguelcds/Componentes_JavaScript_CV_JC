Entre mi Hobbys destaca mi pasion por la musica, sobre todo por la Bateria, funcion que desempeño en mi Grupo Linea de Costa, tambien en los deportes como en futbol y actualmente me esta dando por el Padel.",

  aboutMe_English:
    "My name is João (or Juan, as some people call me), and I was born in Lisbon. I grew up in Fuerteventura and later moved to Bilbao. Currently, I`m a student of Web Development. I decided to get into the world of programming because it's something that has always fascinated me, but life hasn't allowed me to develop it until now, so I've taken a leap of faith to learn and develop the necessary knowledge and skills to work in this field.
